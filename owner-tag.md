# owner tag

I created the green owner tag in the packages [issues](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/packages/issues?state=open) so we can 
quickly see if an owner of the org put the issue in. I kept looking at the same ones over and over, I thought this would be
a quicker way to see if I needed to help the community vs someone who could just do it themselves.
